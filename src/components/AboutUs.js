                                <sup>th</sup>, 2019, Gyumri Information Technologies Center started 
                                programming courses in Yeghegnadzor, region of Vayots Dzor. 
                                GITC is the first to come to Vayots Dzor and to organize such an amazing program. 
                                One of the main goals of GITC is to decentralize the information and high-tech industry 
                                from the capital to the regions, that the young people stay in their regions and work 
                                for the sake of their own community. Thanks to this eight-month course, the students 
                                gained excellent knowledge and have been able to create a useful platform for the 
                                citizens of the region. The purpose of the platform is to help both employers and job 
                                seekers to find the best talent or the best job. As an employer, you have the chance 
                                to easily find highly qualified professionals and manage your time in a more 
                                efficient way. As a job seeker, you have the opportunity to quickly find the job you 
                                are interested in. So, let's explore the job market together and find the best job and 
                                the best employee with the help of our website which is the first and unique website
